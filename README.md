# calculator
Calculator for The Odin Project make with HTML, CSS and JS.

# INFO
As of now, the calculator can do calculations with an infinite ammount of numbers, alternating between operations.
However, there's some behaviours that I would like to change but I think I lack the knowledge to fix that for now, so I might revisit this later.
I'm proud of the result though, but I also think the logic can be shorter, so I'll update you in any case.
Also, the calculator can grow if the number is too large, I have to fix that as well.

# LIVE PREVIEW
Check out a [live preview](https://kagunecode.github.io/calculator/) of the website. Let me know if I can improve anything.
